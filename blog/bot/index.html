          <p>You might have noticed that the creators discord account was suspended for two years because discord thinks he is under the age of 13. Verifying the age might take a while for discords' lazy staff which could lead to the bot being deleted.</p>
        <p>
        So before that happens, we are informing our Servers that we are switching bots, before its too late.</p>
        
        <p>Nothing of the code will change. Everything will be the same, except that the bot will have a newer account.</p>
        <p>We will not change back the bot if our account does gets unbanned for safety reasons of the bot.</p>
