          <p>We're excited to announce that we're on the lookout for some awesome people to join our project! We've been making great growth lately but we know there's so much more we can achieve with the right team.</p>
        <p>So, what are we searching for? Well, we need some staff members. If you're an experienced moderator, a coding pro, or just someone with a ton of enthusiasm, we want to hear from you! Your skills and creativity could be exactly what we need to take Admin Helper to the next level!<br><br>
            But that's not all. We're also in need of some cool advertisers who can help us spread Admin Helper. If you've got skills or are interested for promotion and want to be part of something that will reach many servers, we'd love to have you on our team too.
        </p>

        <p>Everyone who contributes, whether as staff or as an advertiser will be credited right in Admin Helpers <code>/about</code> command even if you leave our team. That way the whole community can see the amazing work you've done to help Admin Helper grow.</p>
        <p>If you're interested in joining our team or helping us get the word out hop on our <a href="https://discord.gg/uzWcAZbP8V">Discord Server</a> and let us know. We can't wait to welcome you and see the awesome things we'll all accomplish!</p>
